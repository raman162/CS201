Graduate Student: Name: Simpson Homer Jay ANumber: A20253512 Major: CS
Undergraduate Student: Name: Walwyn-Venugopal Raman Stephen ANumber: A20296946 Major: MMAE

Showing the adding of a student rasta to the students array
Undergraduate Student: Name: Odrzywolska Sylwia NA ANumber: A20250522 Major: CHE
Graduate Student: Name: Simpson Homer Jay ANumber: A20253512 Major: CS
Undergraduate Student: Name: Walwyn-Venugopal Raman Stephen ANumber: A20296946 Major: MMAE

Another form of polymorphism is when the program performs the checkMax and checkMin functions
0 This is the check min value for Undergrad
6 This is the check min value for Grad
2 This is the check max value Undergrad
-4 This is the check max value Grad
 
Another form of polymorphism to display is the token string which is used when writing the updated list of students to the file
